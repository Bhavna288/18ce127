              <p>The 720S was launched at the Geneva Motor Show on 7 March 2017 and is built on a modified carbon monocoque, which is lighter and stiffer in contrast to the 650S.</p>
              <h3>Specifications</h3><hr>

              <h3>Engine</h3>
              <hr>
              <p><div class="engine"><img src="https://cars.mclaren.com/content/dam/mclaren-automotive/models/720s/720s/overview/1920x1080/P14%20engine%202.jpg"></div>The 720S features McLaren's new M840T engine which is an evolution of the M838T used in the 650S. It is a 3,994 cc (4.0 L; 243.7 cu in) twin-turbocharged V8 engine. However, the stroke has been lengthened by 3.6 mm to increase the capacity and 41% of the engine's components are new. The engine uses new twin-scroll turbochargers which have a low inertia titanium-aluminium turbines which spin with maximum efficiency with the help of actively controlled waste gates. The engine has a rated power output of 720 PS (530 kW; 710 hp) at 7,000 rpm, giving the car its name; the maximum torque is 568 lb⋅ft (770 N⋅m) at 5,500 rpm.</p>

              <p><span class="interior"><img src="https://cdn.carbuzz.com/gallery-images/2020-mclaren-720s-dashboard-carbuzz-365609.jpg"></span>The interior is designed to be a blend of modern and race inspired elements. Alcantara and Weir leather upholstery along with carbon fibre trim are standard. A Bowers and Wilkins audio system is also standard equipment. Fixed carbon fibre racing seats are included as an option. The main focus of the interior is the driver and this is reflected by the new digital display behind the steering wheel which retracts to a thin screen to reveal vital information to the driver when the car is in track mode. The touch screen on the centre console is angled away from the driver but vital controls are designed to be in the driver's easy reach. The car comes with two driving modes, default and comfort with the former focusing on an enhanced track driving experience.</p>
              <h3>Performance</h3><hr>
              <p>According to McLaren the 720S can accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.9 seconds, to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 7.8 seconds, can achieve a maximum speed of 341 km/h (212 mph), and has a 1⁄4 mile (402 m) time of 10.3 seconds. The 720S also comes with Variable Drift Mode, which manipulates the stability control to help drift the car.</p>
              <h3>Efficiency</h3><hr>
              <p>McLaren claims class-leading efficiency for the new 720S, with CO2 emissions of 249 g/km and combined fuel economy of 26.4 mpg‑imp (22.0 mpg‑US)—both of these figures represent an improvement of around 10% from the 650S.</p>
              <h3>What's New for 2020?</h3><hr>
                McLaren introduced the drop-top 720S Spider last year, but the company chose not to make any meaningful changes to the lineup for 2020.
